# Aspose.OCR Java for IntelliJ IDEA (Maven)

The project is **Intellij IDEA (JetBrains Java IDE) maven plugin** facilitates java developer to comfortably work with **Aspose.OCR for Java API** and utilize the API in Java Applications within the IntelliJ IDEA.

**Aspose.OCR for Java** is an optical character & marker recognition component allowing the programmers to add OCR & OMR technology into their Java applications quickly and easily. 

While **OMR** features can be used to process questionnaires, ballots, educational tests and ordering sheets, where the documents to be processed are filled in by hand, and scanned images of such forms are used for marker recognition.

The plugin is aimed at developers who are using IntelliJ IDEA and need to find text in image files. It allows developers to extract text from images quickly and easily, saving the time and efforts by creating Aspose.OCR for Java API enabled projects. The Project wizard also gives option to create the Example source codes for using the API effectively.

The plugin comes with two useful wizards:

1.  **Aspose-OCR Maven Project** Wizard - To create **Aspose.OCR for Java API** Maven project
2.  **Aspose.OCR Examples** - To create / download **Aspose.OCR for Java API** Examples Source Codes (Which is meant to demonstrate the usages of the API)

**Wizards Detail:**

1.  **Aspose.OCR Maven Project** wizard, after installing the plugin, can be run from **File->New Project->Aspose.OCR Maven Project** option. You will have to follow the wizard steps asking for the project information i.e **Project Name, Artifact ID** for your maven project or whether you want to download the Examples Source Codes (for later addition into the project).
2.  **Aspose.OCR Examples** wizard lets you create /copy downloaded Source Code Examples into your project. All the examples withn the selected category will be copied/ created inside "**com.aspose.ocr.examples**" package and also the corresponding directory structure for the package will be created within "src/main/resources" folder which is needed to run the examples.

## What is Aspose.OCR Java API?

The API is extensible, easy to use and compact. It provides common functionality so that developers have to write less code when performing common tasks.

Aspose.OCR is aimed at developers who need to find text in image files from within their own applications. It allows developers to extract text from images quickly and easily, saving the time and effort involved in developing an OCR solution from scratch.
